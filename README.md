## Description

As a take-home chalenge, I was given 8 hours to develop a responsive news reader web application built with React that fetches and displays news articles from a News API. It allows users to view a list of articles, search for specific articles, and view detailed information about each article.

## Features

- **Article List**: Displays a list of news articles with headlines, images, descriptions, and publication dates.
- **Search Functionality**: Allows users to filter articles based on keywords.
- **Detailed Article View**: Clicking on an article opens a detailed view with the full content, source, and additional information.
- **Routing**: Utilizes React Router for navigation between the article list and detailed views, enabling users to use the browser's back button and direct links.

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone git@github.com:Virulencies/news-reader.git
   cd news-reader

2. **Install dependencies**:
   cd into news-repo in your machine, then install the dependencies with 
   ```sh
   npm install

3. **Run the app**:
   Run the app in a localhost instance in your browser with
   ```sh
   npm start
   
Once running, simply click any article or search for anything that piques your interest!
